    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <hr width="100%" style="background-color: #D61355; height: 5px;">

    <h3>I have always had a passion for technology and began my journey in the field by coding in 8th grade using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. As I progressed
        through my education I became increasingly interested in mechanical engineering as well. However, my passion for software development never wavered and I
        continued to explore it on the side. During the pandemic, I took the opportunity to fully immerse myself in software development and began working as a
        freelancer. I have been honing my skills ever since, and I am now seeking software development opportunities to take my career to the next level.
    </h3>

    <h3>
        In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects and have several available for you to view on my GitHub profile. I have experience in multiple programming languages.
        I have worked on web development, and mobile app development and have been involved in multiple projects that have been deployed to production.
        I am excited to show you what I can do and would be honoured to have the opportunity to work with a reputable organization.
        I am confident that my skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for software development roles,
        and I would be grateful for just a couple of minutes of your valuable time to discuss how my skills and experience could benefit your organization.
